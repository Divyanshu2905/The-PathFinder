# [The Path-Finder](https://divyanshu2905.github.io/The-PathFinder/)

The project aims to implement and compare two popular pathfinding algorithms, Dijkstra and A* (A-Star), in order to find the shortest path between two points in a given graph. The project's main objective is to analyze the efficiency and performance of these algorithms in different scenarios.

## Dijkstra

The Dijkstra algorithm is a graph search algorithm used to determine the shortest path between a starting node and all other nodes in a weighted graph. It explores all possible paths from the starting node, assigning tentative distances to each node until the shortest path is found.

## A*

The A* algorithm combines elements of Dijkstra's algorithm with heuristics to improve efficiency. It uses a heuristic function, typically an estimated distance from a node to the goal, to guide the search towards the most promising paths. This heuristic helps prioritize exploration and can significantly reduce the number of nodes visited compared to Dijkstra's algorithm.


The project will also include a user interface to input the graph and define the start and goal nodes. The implemented algorithms will then compute and display the shortest path between these nodes, along with the associated cost. Additionally, the project will record and compare the number of nodes visited by each algorithm to evaluate their efficiency.

Through this project, users will gain a better understanding of the differences and trade-offs between Dijkstra and A* algorithms for pathfinding. They will be able to observe how the choice of algorithm can affect the computational time and resource requirements for finding the shortest path in various scenarios.
